# Password Generator

This is a simple JavaScript password generator. When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they are prompted to choose the length of the password and the types of characters to include (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters). The generator then creates a random password that meets the user's specifications and displays it on the page.

## Installation
